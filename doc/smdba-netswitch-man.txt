==================
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
smdba-netswitch - Orace database server network listening mode switcher.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*smdba-netswitch* 'COMMAND'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The smdba-netswitch(1) command changes Oracle database listening from
"world-wide" to "localhost-only" and vice versa. It is highly recommended to
use "localhost-only" mode in order to address possible remote attacks,
exploiting security holes in Oracle database.


IMPORTANT
---------
This tool is not working with any other database vendor.


COMMANDS
--------
*localhost*::
    Set Oracle database and its listeners listening only to the 'localhost' or
    "'127.0.0.1'" loopback. This will make impossible to access the database
    remotely in any way.

*worldwide*::
    Set Oracle database and its listeners listening incoming connections
    world-wide, or to "'0.0.0.0'". This will make possible to access the
    database remotely with any tools.


WARNING!
--------
If your Oracle database is listening world-wide, you directly exposing
potential security holes in the Oracle ecosystem. It is 'highly recommended' to
turn world-wide listeners *OFF*, by switching listeners to *localhost only*.
