NAME
----
smdba - SUSE Manager database control tool.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*smdba* 'COMMAND' ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The smdba(1) command transparently controls the installed database
backend in the SUSE Manager appliance. It offers basic operations and
backup options for the daily maintenance.


IMPORTANT
---------
Set of available commands may differ, depending on the database backend is
currently in use. Therefore some commands might not be available and therefore
not shown in the list or behave different.

Each command can have expanded help by adding "'help'" directive (see an example
below).


COMMANDS
--------
*backup-check*::
    Check the consistency of the backup if it is usable to recover the
    database after the disaster or not. Function will check latest backup and
    its location. Command have an additional parameter 'autoresolve' which will
    try to automatically resolve errors and inconsistencies, fixing broken
    backup, if possible.

*backup-hot*::
    Perform hot backup on running database. This function 'requires' database
    to be healthy and running.
    Backup is rotated automatically by SMDBA on each available
    database backend and no interaction is required to minimize it. In
    order to refresh the backup, the old one needs to be archived and
    new, frech backup can be taken as is.
    Optionally, this command might differ, depending on the database
    vendor at your current system, therefore additionally it may
    accept optional parameters like *--key='VALUE'*:

    *--enable='ATTRIBUTE'*;;
        Valid attribute values are: "'on'" or "'off'". It might be not
        required for currently installed database backend and is
        needed only once, when enabling or disabling the backup.

    *--backup-dir='ATTRIBUTE'*;;
        Full path to the backup directory. Is might be not required
        for currently installed database backend and is needed only
        once when enabling or disabling backup.

*backup-list*::
    List of available backups.

*backup-purge*::
